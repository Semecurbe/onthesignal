Powered by two new proprietary ASICs (Tek079 and Tek085), the oscilloscope provides the industry's lowest noise and highest Effective Number of Bits (ENOB). The series debuts with a bandwidth of up to 25 GHz and offers data offload speeds up to 10 times faster than legacy instruments.

## Key Features and Innovations
Unmatched Signal Fidelity: Delivers an industry-leading ENOB (7.5 bits at 8 GHz to 6.5 bits at 25 GHz) due to its ultra-low random noise.

* QuietChannel™ Technology: Uses active equalization to compensate for signal loss, reducing noise and improving measurement accuracy.
* Breakthrough Speed: Achieves up to 10x faster data transfer with 10G SFP+ LAN and the TekHSI™ library.
ù Scalable Architecture: Built with an upgradeable architecture and compatibility with the TekConnect® probe interface to protect long-term investment.

Modern Workflow Integration: Features a 15.6” 1080p touchscreen, native serial analysis tools, and dual support for both Windows and Linux operating systems.

## Software and Availability

The 7 Series runs on TekScope® software, providing a consistent and intuitive user experience. The first model, the DPO714AX, is available for order now.
