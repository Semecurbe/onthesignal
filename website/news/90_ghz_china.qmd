## Key Features and Innovations


An oscilloscope is a crucial piece of equipment that serves as the "eyes" for engineers by converting invisible electrical signals into visible waveforms. According to Liu Sang, CEO of one of the developers (Shenzhen Longsight Technologies), this achievement required sustained innovation across materials, manufacturing, chips, and algorithms.
